# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
Using Data from www.kaggle.com containing used cars data from the US market
If you intend to try texting the python console application for predictions, you have to unzip the saved model file and copy all files as shown.
The saved model file was zipped because one of the models was over 25 MB and could not be uploaded on github directly.
Kindly reach me on my email if you have any issues using the console or any question (wallacepatrick2015wp@gmail.com).
